    "This notebook will be an overview of my entire process of cleaning data and creating a model to try and predict winners in the NCAA tournament. All of the data for this project has already been scraped and downloaded from the following sources: basketball-reference.com, basketball.realgm.com, simplemaps.com and barttorvik.com. \n",

    "Bart Torvik is the creator of the \"T-Rank\" website that calculates advanced stats such as adjusted offensive and adjusted defensive efficiency for college basketball teams dating back to 2008. One of the benefits of using this site is the ability to filter the rankings by any timeframe within a season. I downloaded team efficiency numbers for each month of a season as I am interested in learning if performance peaks and valleys throughout a season are important factors in determining tournament game winners. \n",
    "\n",
    "The t-rank efficiency numbers should prove to be one of the better predictors of tournament winners and since this information is not available prior to 2008, I will only use data from 2008-2019 to make predictions. \n"

The other 4 files contain team adjusted efficiency stats for each month of the college basketball season. Adjusted offensive efficiency and adjusted defensive efficiency are the competition adjusted number of points scored and given up per 100 possessions. The two other main stats included in the t-rank table are WAB and barthag. Barthag is just another name for the pythagorean expectation rating and is based on the adjoe and adjde ratings. WAB stands for wins above bubble and is a measure of how many more games a team has won compared to how many of those game a bubble team would have expected to win.

    "The ap_pre columns currently have the preseason rank for each school and the value 26 if a team was not ranked in the top 25. One issue with this is that a non-ranked school could actually be the 26th best team in the pre-season or the 100th best. As it currently stands, those rankings mean the same thing and the difference between those schools and the number 25 team in the country would both be one. To overcome this, I will convert the columns to categorical based on specific cutoff rankings, and then create dummy variables that contain either a 1 or 0 if a team falls into that ranking. I have decided to create ranking based on top 5, top 15, top 25, and not ranked. Each school will only have 1 column populated, so even though a top 5 team is also a top 15 team, it will only have a 1 in the top 5 column. "
